# Active Context

## Current Focus (Dec 9, 2025)
- Add Homebrew tap support so the project can be installed via `brew tap` + `brew install`.
- Create baseline Memory Bank files for continuity.

## Recent Notes
- No Git tags/releases present; pyproject version is 0.1.0.
- Need a Formula that can install from a source tarball (likely GitHub archive); may require updating once a tagged release exists.

## Next Steps
- Author a Homebrew formula (`Formula/dbutils.rb`) using Python virtualenv helper.
- Document tap usage in README.
- Consider publishing a tagged release to provide stable tarball/sha256 for the formula.
