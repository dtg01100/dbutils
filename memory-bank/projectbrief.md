# Project Brief

Utilities and GUI tools for exploring DB2 (and JDBC-accessible) database schemas. Provides CLI/TUI utilities to map tables/columns, infer relationships, generate JOIN snippets, diff schemas, and browse metadata via a Qt-based interface. Targets real JDBC connections (mock mode only for tests).
